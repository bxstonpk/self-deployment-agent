# Platform API — Draft & Validated States (State 1–2)

Go implementation of the Business API, built one Application Lifecycle state
at a time. Currently covers **Draft** and **Validated**.

Implements from
[`../../docs/02_Functional_Requirements.md`](../../docs/02_Functional_Requirements.md):
`FR-011`, `FR-012`, `FR-013`, `FR-015` (Modules D/E — Draft state), and
`FR-019`, `FR-021`, `FR-023`, `FR-024`, `FR-029`, `FR-030`, `FR-031`(partial),
`FR-033`, `FR-034` (Modules F/G/H — Validated state; `FR-032` resource quota
is honestly reported as **skipped**, not faked — see below). See
[`../../docs/13_API_Requirements.md`](../../docs/13_API_Requirements.md) for
the Business API this implements, and
[`../../docs/10_System_Architecture.md`](../../docs/10_System_Architecture.md)
for how it fits the Control Plane.

## What's implemented

| Endpoint | FR | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /applications` | FR-011, FR-012, FR-015 | Registers an app in `draft` state; caller becomes primary owner |
| `GET /applications` | — | Paginated list |
| `GET /applications/{id}` | — | |
| `PATCH /applications/{id}` | FR-013 | Metadata only — never changes lifecycle state; owner-only |
| `GET /applications/{id}/owners` | FR-015 | |
| `PUT /applications/{id}/deployment-yaml` | FR-023 | Saves a `deployment.yaml` draft (must parse as YAML); reverts `validated` back to `draft` since the contract changed; owner-only |
| `POST /applications/{id}/validate` | FR-029–034 | Runs the aggregate validation pass; `draft` → `validated` on success. Only callable from `draft`. Owner-only |
| `GET /supported-stacks` | FR-019 | Lists the IT-governed Supported Stack catalog (seeded by migration `0002`) |

### Validation report shape

`POST /applications/{id}/validate` returns `{"application": {...}, "report": {"valid": bool, "checks": [...]}}`.
Each check is `passed`, `failed`, or **`skipped`** — `resource_quota` is
always `skipped` because Module M (Resource Manager) doesn't exist yet and
exact quota numbers are TBD (`DEC-014`). This mirrors the docs' rule of
never inventing a business decision: an honest "not implemented yet" beats a
fake pass.

The one concretely-enforced part of FR-031 (security pre-check) so far: any
top-level field outside `app/services/database/scaling/resources/domain` is
rejected outright (`security_precheck` check, via strict YAML field
checking) — there is no way to smuggle raw Kubernetes/Docker config through
`deployment.yaml`, regardless of who or what generated it.

## What's deliberately NOT here yet

Each will land as its own feature branch/PR, per the Application Lifecycle:

- Build Engine (`Build` state), Deployment Controller integration
  (`Deploying`/`Running` states).
- Real authentication — see **Dev-mode auth** below.
- Resource quota enforcement (FR-032) — depends on Module M, not built yet.
- Audit logging (Module W) — several FRs call for audit entries; not
  implemented until the Audit module exists.
- Full RBAC / Role / Permission tables (Module A/B) — blocked on `DEC-001`.
- Stack version governance (FR-022, deprecated/blocked versions) — the
  catalog only tracks active/deprecated/blocked per whole runtime name, not
  per version range yet.

## Dev-mode auth (temporary — see DEC-001)

There is no Identity Provider integration yet (`DEC-001` in
[`17_Decision_Log.md`](../../docs/17_Decision_Log.md) is still **Open**). All
`/applications` routes require these headers, and the service refuses to
start this path at all unless `PLATFORM_ENV=dev`:

```
X-Dev-User-Email: alice@example.com
X-Dev-User-Name:  Alice Employee      # optional
X-Dev-Department: Engineering         # optional, defaults to "Unassigned"
```

The user/department are upserted on first use. This entire mechanism
(`internal/httpapi/devauth.go`) sits behind the `Authenticator` interface so
it can be swapped for real SSO without touching any handler — see `NFR-051`.

## Running locally

From the repo root, first time only:

```
cp .env.example .env   # then edit POSTGRES_PASSWORD if you want a non-default value
```

`.env` is git-ignored — `docker-compose.yml` reads all credentials from it
and refuses to start with a clear error if it's missing (see
`.env.example` for what's needed). Then:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Then:

```
curl -X POST localhost:8080/applications \
  -H "X-Dev-User-Email: alice@example.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"overtime","description":"HR overtime tracker","owning_department_id":"<department-uuid>"}'
```

(`owning_department_id` must be a real department UUID — dev-mode auth
auto-creates one from `X-Dev-Department` on first request; fetch it from the
`departments` table, or extend this flow with a `GET /departments` endpoint
in a future state.)

## Running tests

```
cd services/platform-api
go test ./...
```

Service-layer tests (`internal/service`) use in-memory fakes and need no
database. There are no repository-layer (Postgres) tests yet — a future
increment should add them against a real Postgres instance (e.g. via
`docker compose` in CI), since the partial-unique-index and CHECK constraints
in the migration are part of the actual correctness guarantees.

Both states have also been manually verified end-to-end against a real
Postgres instance via `docker compose up --build` — see the PR descriptions
for the exact `curl` sessions exercised (registration, validation pass/fail,
edit-reverts-to-draft, cross-owner rejection, unsupported-stack rejection,
unknown-field rejection).
